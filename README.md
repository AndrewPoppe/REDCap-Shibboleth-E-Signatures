# Shibboleth Authenticator

This module enables users who authenticate using Shibboleth to lock and e-sign instruments.

**Note**: The module assumes that the REDCap server achieves Shibboleth authentication by redirecting users to a Shibboleth IdP login as opposed to requiring Shibboleth authentication on every page. For the latter, see [this module](https://github.com/susom/redcap-em-shibboleth-esignature)
